Observable Trends

1. There is little to no correaltion between latitude and cloudiness
2. Being closer to the equator is correlated with higher temperatures. Conversely, the data points further away from the equator tended to have lower max temperatures
3. The linear regression models involving latitiude and max temp had very strong correlations in both hemispheres. The northern hemisphere model was negatively correlated with a r-squared of -0.85, while the southern hemisphere model was positively correlated with a r-squared of 0.71
